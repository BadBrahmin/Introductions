Hi, I'm Tejas 

A Manipal Uni alumnus, I took up digital marketing after a very interesting internship with OnePlus. 
Over the 2.5 years, I worked with brands like redbus, HDFC life, Deshpande Foundation and many more,
collectively collaborating with more than 20 brands, creating content and running effective campaigns.
I'm a proud self-learnt marketer but not knowing how to code basic pages hurt me professionally.
I missed out on a lot of brilliant campaigns because I had to depend on under-staffed tech teams to get landing pages/games/microsites done. 
Then when I wanted to transition to Growth Marketing, I constantly found myself playing catch-up rather than adding value.
The bitterness of not knowing to code further intensified when I looked to build SaaS and app products.
Everyone has ideas but it's the execution that matters and the elusive coders know that.
This is my effort to upskill and develop into a T shaped skilled individual by
efficiently leveraging my marketing knowledge with frontend development.
